## Abstract 
Image schemas are spatio-temporal cognitive building blocks that capture recurring sensorimotor experiences. Few existing approaches for automatic detection of image schemas from natural language rely on specific rules and assumptions about word classes as indicators of spatio-temporal events. Furthermore, the lack of sufficiently large, annotated datasets makes evaluation and supervised learning difficult. We propose to build on the recent success of large multilingual pretrained language models and a small dataset of examples from image schema literature to train a supervised classifier to classify natural language expressions of varying lengths into image schemas. Despite most of the training data being in English with few examples for German, the model performs best in German. Additionally, we analyse the modelâ€™s zero-shot performance in Russian, French, and Mandarin. To further investigate the model's behaviour, we utilize local linear approximations for prediction probabilities that indicate which words in a sentence the model relies on for its final classification decision.
